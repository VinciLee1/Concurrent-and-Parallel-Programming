compile and execute putMem, this will create a shared memroy address,
and then copy the string "Hello, World!" to that memroy address.
An infinite loop will start until the first char of that shared memory address is not 'H'.

compile and execute editMem, you will chage the first char of the above shared memroy address, so the putMem process will exit.
